      <p>
        Hello everyone! My name is Kenton Rhoden and I am a third year
        <em>Computer Science</em> major at <strong>Cal Poly SLO</strong>. I love
        learning anything about computers, and have developed a strong passion
        for <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am not tampering with technology, I love practicing jiu jitsu,
        listening to music, playing videogames, or working out at the gym.
      </p>
      <p>Nice to meet you all!</p>
